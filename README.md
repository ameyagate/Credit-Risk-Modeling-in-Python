### [Project: Credit-Risk-Modeling-in-Python](https://github.com/ameyagate/Credit-Risk-Modeling-in-Python/blob/main/Credit%20Risk%20Modeling.ipynb)
* Developed model to predict applicant credit risk, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data transformation (one-hot encoding, min-max normalization), resulting in 93.5% accuracy score
* Applied multiple classification algorithms in Python to classify loan applicants into binary classes (approved, not approved)  
* Implemented 6 machine learning algorithms : K-means Clustering, Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, k-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Classifier in Python
