### [Project: Credit-Risk-Modeling-in-Python](https://github.com/ameyagate/Credit-Risk-Modeling-in-Python/blob/main/Credit%20Risk%20Modeling.ipynb)
* Developed predictive model to identify credit risk, performed data transformation (one-hot encoding, min-max normalization) and exploratory data analysis (EDA), resulting in 94% accuracy score
* Implemented 6 machine learning algorithms : K-means Clustering, Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, k-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Classifier in Pythonr
